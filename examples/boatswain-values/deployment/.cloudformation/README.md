# AWS CloudFormation Templates

boatswain has the ability to provision staging environments with AWS resources generated from CloudFormation templates. It can provision an EBS Volume to store MySQL data, ElastiCache, RDS, SQS â€” anything the app needs to function. CloudFormation templates are defined in the deployment/.cloudformation directory, invoked in servicemap definitions, and once provisioned will output an identifier to be dropped into the autogenerated values file and consumed by the staging app.

## Tracing a CloudFormation resource from template to autogenerated value

### CloudFormation template

Let's use the cloudformation template `ebs-hydra-mysql.yaml`. It looks like this:

```yaml
# deployment/.cloudformation/ebs-hydra-mysql.yaml

AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Description: >-
  App: Hydra DB
  Create EBS Volume from a snapshot for the Hydra MySQL database. 
Metadata:
  Name: ebs-hydra-mydql
Resources:
  EBSVolume:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::Volume"
    Properties:
      AvailabilityZone: us-west-2a
      Encrypted: false
      Size: 100
      Tags:
        - Key: datasource
          Value: hydra
      VolumeType: standard
      SnapshotId: snap-12345
Outputs:
  AwsEbsVolumeId:
    Description: AwsEbsVolumeId
    Value: !Ref EBSVolume
 ```
 
 ### servicemap
 
 In order to make use of this template, we need to invoke this template _by file name_ in a servicemap definition. Like this:
 ```yaml
 # deployment/.servicemaps/staging.yaml
 
 ServiceMaps:
   - Name: hydra
     CloudFormationTemplate: ebs-hydra-mysql
 ```
  
This is the complete servicemap entry for hydra. It doesn't need to talk to any other services, and its database lives in the same deployment, so there's no `Test` or `Staging` services.

 ### boatswain

When boatswain pushes hydra to staging (`boatswain stage push hydra branch-name`) it will check for a `CloudFormationTemplate` value in the servicemap for hydra, and if it finds something, it will look for that template by name in the .cloudformation directory, and create the CloudFormation stack from the template using the AWS SDK. 
 
 ### values.yaml

The AWS SDK will return some kind of output on creating the CloudFormation stack. This output is customizable based on the needs of the app. To take our ebs-hydra-mysql.yaml sample again:
```yaml
Outputs:
  AwsEbsVolumeId:
    Description: AwsEbsVolumeId
    Value: !Ref EBSVolume
```
This block of yaml tells AWS to return the AwsEbsVolumeId value from the stack and set it to the property name `AwsEbsVolumeId`. boatswain assumes that whatever is outputted from the AWS SDK CreateStack command needs to be dropped into the autogenerated values file. So we end up with something like this:

```yaml
# deployment/hydra/autogenerated/values.staging.my-branch.yaml
Boatswain:
  CloudFormationValues:
    AwsEbsVolumeId: vol-abc123
```

It's then up to the developer to configure the helm templates to make use of `.Values.Boatswain.CloudFormationValues.AwsEbsVolumeId`.

## Do you even CloudFormate?
