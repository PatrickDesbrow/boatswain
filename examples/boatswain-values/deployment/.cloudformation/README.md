# AWS CloudFormation Templates
Boatswain has the ability to provision staging environments with AWS services generated via CloudFormation templates as CloudFormation stacks. `ebs-hydra-mysql.yaml` will be called in `boatswain stage push hydra branch-name`. This template will spin up an EBS volume from the snapshot `snap-12345` defined in the template. The output of this stack, defined in the `Outputs` section of the template, will be carried over to the autogenerated values files generated from the `boatswain stage push` command. For instance, the output below will take the EBS volume ID generated from the CloudFormation stack and drop it in the values files as `.Values.Boatswain.CloudFormationValues.AwsEbsVolumeId`. These outputs are fully customizable.
